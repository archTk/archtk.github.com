<div class="description">
    <p>The ARCH Network Editor has been developed in the context of the ARCH FP7 project.<br /><br />It allows the creation of model-based patient-specific vascular networks to be used for blood flow simulations. Simulations are carried out with the pyNS solver, which, beyond running the simulations, provides network meshing capabilities.<br />Elements characteristics, simulation parameters and boundary conditions can be easily defined before performing the simulations.<br />Simulation results are then dispalyed, allowing fluid-dynamic evaluations.</p>
