<div class="description">
    <p>The archTk is an open-source toolkit developed in the context of the ARCH FP7 project. It is currently composed of the ARCH Network Editor and the pyNS solver.<br /><br />It allows the creation of model-based patient-specific vascular networks to be used for blood flow simulations. Simulations are carried out with the pyNS solver, which, beyond running the simulations, provides network meshing capabilities.<br />Elements characteristics, simulation parameters and boundary conditions can be easily defined before performing the simulations.<br />Simulation results are then dispalyed.</p>
