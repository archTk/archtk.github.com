<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<div class="description">
    <p>Here you can get information on the usage of the ARCH Network Editor.<br /><br />The tutorial gives an overview of the editor capabilities, guiding you through the steps of creating a network, defining elements characteristics, submit the network to simulation and review the results.<br /><br />Let's start by launching the application. The main window should appear on the screen.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/mainWindow.png" alt="Starting screen">
    </div>
You see the toolbar on the top, some other tool buttons on the left and the editing area (the light gray dotted portion) in the middle of the screen.<br />The status bar at the bottom of the screen provides messages on the application status (now it says 'Ready') and also useful hints about the functionalities of the tools when the mouse is on any icon. All the functionalities displayed on the screen can also be accessed from the menu bar at the top of the screen (the menu bar is not shown in the picture).<br /><br />Selecting the <b>'GREEN PLUS'</b> icon (addSegment tool) on top of the left buttons allows you to create new edges of the network. Just click in the editor area, drag and release.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/firstEdgeCreation.png" alt="First edge">
    </div>
The showGrid and snapToGrid options are activated by default. If you don't like them, just deselect the corresponding icons in the toolbar.
    <div class="icons_container">
            <img class="icon" src="media/grid.png" alt="Grid">
            <img class="icon" src="media/snapToGrid.png" alt="Snap to Grid">
    </div>
You can add other edges by clicking, dragging and releasing.<br />
     <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/otherEdgesCreation.png" alt="Other edges">
    </div>
Clicking on a node when the mouse-cursor is close to it (the node is yellow-highlighted), makes the edge to start on that node, sharing the node with the other edge.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/connectedEdges.png" alt="Connected edges">
    </div>
The same applyies on mouse release: releasing the mouse when the cursor is close to a node (again, yellow-highlighted), connects the edge to the edges owning the node.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/moreConnections.png" alt="More connections">
    </div>
After all this work, it's time to save our network. Click on the <b>'DISK'</b> icon in the toolbar, insert the name (here we use example) and the location (for us ARCHtk: ARCHtk_tutorial folder) you want the network to be saved in and that's it!
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/exampleSaved.png" alt="Example has been saved">
    </div>
The name of the network is written at the top of the window application: before it was 'untitled', now it is 'example'.<br />Let's have a look at the files the application has saved. 
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="smallShot" src="media/exampleFolder.png" alt="Files in the folder">
    </div>
There is an example_graph.xml file and an example_layout.xml file. The first (_graph.xml) has all the information about how nodes and edges are connected, while the second (_layout.xml) stores the graphical appearance of the network.<br />These two files (and also the _mesh.xml file that we will see later) should always stay in the same folder to allow the application to work with them.<br />Going back to our example, click on an edge (still with the addSegment tool selected) and drag to make it to become curved. 
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/curvedEdge.png" alt="The edge is curved now">
    </div>
This is useful when you have an intricated network and you want to see something which is beyond one edge.<br /><br />If you select the <b>'RED CROSS'</b> icon (removeSegment tool) below the addSegment icon, you can remove edges form the network by clicking on them.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/edgeRemoved.png" alt="The edge has been removed">
    </div>
UNDO - REDO functionalities are provided in order to recover if any mistake has been done. They are accessible using the standard keyboard shortcuts or through the Edit menu.<br />The splitSegment tool (<b>'SCISSORS'</b> icon) splits edges in two, dividing them at their middle point. If the edge is too short, the splitting cannot be done.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/splitEdge.png" alt="The edge has been split">
    </div>
The selectElement tool allows to select elements of the network.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/selectedElements.png" alt="Elements have been selected">
    </div>
If you click on selected items, you can move them.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/movedElements.png" alt="The edge has been split">
    </div>
Clicking on the removeEdge tool makes the selected edges to be deleted.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/removedSelected.png" alt="Selected edges have been removed">
    </div>
The information tool (<b>'BLUE ROUNDED i'</b> icon) allows the editing of the characteristics of the elements. Select this tool and click on a node.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/nodeEditing.png" alt="Selected edges have been removed">
    </div>
The editing window appears. It is divided in two portions: the upper displays the information of the element that you can edit, the lower reports the XML representing the element. There is also a 'message line' that displays messages regarding the validity of the inserted information. It also changes its color: green if everything is fine, red otherwise.<br />Double click on the line that you want to edit ('name' in this case), enter the information ('foo') and click on the <b>'APPLY'</b> button to accept it. The same result is obtained by clicking the <b>'OK'</b> button, but this makes the editing window to disappear. 
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/editingAccepted.png" alt="Selected edges have been removed">
    </div>
The name is now reported in the XML too. If you don't want the XML to be shown, deselect the <b>'SHOW/HIDE DOM'</b> functionality.
    <div class="icons_container">
            <img class="icon" src="media/show_dom.png" alt="Show / Hide dom">
    </div>
In case you don't want to accept the changes, click the <b>'RED CROSS'</b> icon or the <b>'RESET'</b> icon.
    <div class="icons_container">
            <img class="icon" src="media/cancel.png" alt="Cancel">
            <img class="icon" src="media/reset.png" alt="Reset">
    </div>
Also here, REDO and UNDO functionalities are provided.<br />Now that the node has a name, click on the <b>'LABEL'</b> icon in the toolbar to make the name to be shown.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/shownName.png" alt="Selected edges have been removed">
    </div>
Now select the 'name' property in the editing area and click on the <b>'Add child element icon'</b>.
    <div class="icons_container">
            <img class="icon" src="media/add_child.png" alt="Add child element">
    </div>
The 'properties' field appears. Again, select it and click on the <b>'Add child element icon'</b> to add new characteristics. To remove fields, use the <b>'REMOVE ELEMENT'</b> function.
    <div class="icons_container">
            <img class="icon" src="media/remove_element.png" alt="Remove element">
    </div>
If any field is mandatory, it cannot be removed.<br />In this way, you can enter any kind of information needed to perform the simulation. We'll see how to launch a simulation later on.<br /><br />Now we'll see how to import an existing network. If the network has not been generated by the ARCH Network Editor, it consists of astand alone XML file. Click on the <b>'IMPORT NETWORK'</b> icon, select the network (test.xml in this case) and the application loads it.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/testNet.png" alt="Imported netwrok">
    </div>
The nodes position is not specified in the xml file we've imported (there is not the _layout.xml file, do you remember?), thus a random position has been assigned to every node. Click on the <b>UNRAVEL</b> icon (maybe more than once)
    <div class="icons_container">
            <img class="icon" src="media/unravel.png" alt="Remove element">
    </div>
to disentangle the network.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/unravelledNet.png" alt="Disentagled netwrok">
    </div>
If you want the position of any node to be blocked during this operation, select the node and click on the <b>BLOCK NODE POSITION'</b> icon. The blocked nodes have a dark red contour and do not move when the net is disentangled.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/blockedNodes.png" alt="Block nodes">
    </div>
On the contrary, if you import a network previously saved by the application using the <b>'OPEN NETWORK'</b>, the nodes position is not randomly assigned, but is taken from the _layout.xml file. That's the reason why the _graph.xml file and the _layout.xml file must stay in the same directory.<br />To see that, save the network you have imported using the 'save as...' function. We use 'newExample' as name. Click on the <b>'NEW NETWORK'</b> icon to empty the editing area and open the network you have just saved.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/newExample.png" alt="New network">
    </div>
The network cannot be seen in its completeness, thus use <b>'TRANSLATE'</b> or <b>'ZOOM IN'</b> or <b>'ZOOM OUT'</b>. To go back to the initial view (in terms of zooming and screen translation), click on the <b>'RESET VIEW'</b> icon. We use <b>'TRANSLATE</b> to translate the screen and to make the whole network visible.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/networkTranslated.png" alt="Network all visible">
    </div>
Clicking on the <b>'DEFAULT MESH'</b> icon applies a default 3-elements mesh to every edge of the network. Mesh elements are displayed as green circles with a letter corresponding to the type of mesh element. The default mesh element is the 0D_FiveDofsV2, represented using the number 5.
    <div class="screenshot_container">
            <img class="screenshot" src="media/defaultMesh.png" alt="default mesh">
    </div>
In order to choose a different type of mesh element to be used, you have to explicitly define it in the network. To do that, perform an UNDO action to return to the netwrok without the mesh and, using the information tool, insert the type of element you want to use.<b>
